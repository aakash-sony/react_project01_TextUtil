# react_project01_TextUtil
It is my first small react project (TextUtils). In this project I have provided the functionality to the user to change the characters in lower case, in upper case, remove extra spaces and copy all characters also in a single click on specific button. In this project I have learned about basics use of react components like props and useState.
